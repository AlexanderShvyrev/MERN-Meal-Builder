# MERN-Meal-Builder
This is a meal builder web-application. The main idea is: user logs in, chooses an item from a menu(pizza, taco, hot dog...) and builds it by dragging desired ingredients on to the item. 
The final step is the meal is getting added to the order, which then can be updated or deleted if the user changes his mind. After the order was placed it gets deleted from database after a certain amount of time.
